# Antivirus-Database
### The other side of the battlefield. Enemies of the Malware-Database, and will fight against them.

These are Antiviruses that are SAFE to run on your computer unlike my rogues from the other repository. These guys are strong enemies of my Malware-Database and will do anything to defeat them. If your in need to remove a virus, get these guys.

Most of these only run on Windows 7/8 or higher.

Unlike our naughty Malware-Database, these antiviruses dont have passwords, they are just archives! So no passwords...

VERY IMPORTANT (POST JUNE 2024): If you are in the United States of America, 46th President Joe Biden has banned Kaspersky products from selling in the USA as of June 20th, 2024. If you live in the US, do not download Kaspersky. Kaspersky is only here for educational reasons and for other countries. Thank you.

IMPORTANT (Before June 2024): If you are downloading Kaspersky and ARE a resident of California, select the "California" option. If you are NOT a resident of the state of California, select the "Non-California" option.
